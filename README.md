# SB29-guard üö¶üìò

Making blocked ed‚Äëtech domains less confusing (and more transparent) for teachers & students. Protecting student data is a noble objective, and can be done in ways that lift up our communities.

<em>Built by a teacher, for teachers ‚Äî to protect educators, reduce friction, and make compliance humane.</em>

District‚Äëfriendly tool that shows a clear, plain‚Äëlanguage ‚ÄúWhy was I redirected?‚Äù page when staff or students try a site without an approved Data Privacy Agreement (SB29 context). One small self‚Äëcontained binary. No tracking. No student data stored.

## The gist
- Show a friendly explanation page when a restricted domain is visited.
- Keep a simple, auditable policy (YAML or Google Sheet).
- Point DNS (A/CNAME/RPZ/hosts) to this service; the page infers the original domain safely.

## Get started
- Easiest (recommended): Easy‚Äëmode with auto‚ÄëHTTPS using Docker + Caddy ‚Äî see `easy-mode/README.md`.
- Prefer your own stack? See implementers overview and deployment guides:
  - `docs/implementers/README.md`
  - `docs/deployment/` (BIND, Unbound, Pi-hole, Windows DNS, pfSense, OPNsense, Infoblox)
